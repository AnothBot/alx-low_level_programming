Title: C - More Functions and Nested Loops

Overview: This module introduces more advanced concepts in C programming, including functions, nested loops, and the use of header files. Students will learn how to define and call functions, pass arguments to functions, and return values from functions. They will also learn how to write nested loops to perform iterative tasks and how to use header files to organize code.

Topics covered in this module include:

Functions:
Defining functions
Calling functions
Passing arguments to functions
Returning values from functions
Nested loops:
Writing nested loops
Iterating over arrays
Nested loops with conditional statements
Header files:
Creating header files
Including header files
Guarding against multiple inclusions
Learning objectives: By the end of this module, students should be able to:

Define and call functions in C programming.
Pass arguments to functions and return values from functions.
Write nested loops to perform iterative tasks.
Use nested loops with conditional statements to perform more complex tasks.
Create header files to organize code and guard against multiple inclusions.
Prerequisites: This module assumes a basic understanding of C programming concepts, including data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops.
