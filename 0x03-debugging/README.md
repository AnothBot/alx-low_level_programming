0x03. C - Debugging
This project is part of the curriculum of the low-level programming track of Holberton School. The goal of this project is to learn about debugging techniques in C programming.

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in a computer program. It is an important skill for any software developer, as it helps to ensure that programs are functioning correctly and efficiently.

In this project, we will be working with C programs that contain bugs, and we will use various debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix these bugs. We will learn how to use the gcc compiler's -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic flags to help catch common errors, as well as how to use tools like gdb and valgrind to debug more complex issues.

At the end of this project, we should have a better understanding of how to debug C programs and be able to apply these skills to future programming projects.
