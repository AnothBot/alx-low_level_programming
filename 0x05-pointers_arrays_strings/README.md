Project Title: 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

This project is part of the ALX software engineering curriculum  and it aims to teach students the basic concepts of pointers, arrays and strings in the C programming language. Students will learn how to use pointers to manipulate data, how to declare and manipulate arrays, how to use strings and how to work with the memory layout of a program.

Concepts:
The following concepts are covered in this project:

Pointers and arrays
Data Structures

Requirements:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
The code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
No more than 5 functions per file
The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in the header file main.h
The header file main.h should be pushed to the repository
The code should not use global variables
The standard library is not allowed. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc... is forbidden
The function _putchar is allowed
The files main.c are provided as examples, but they are not part of the submission and won't be taken into account
You donâ€™t have to push _putchar.c, as the school will use its own file
Plagiarism of any kind is forbidden and will result in removal from the program

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, students are expected to be able to explain:

What are pointers and how to use them
What are arrays and how to use them
What are the differences between pointers and arrays
How to use strings and how to manipulate them
Scope of variables
Files
The following files are included in this project:

0-reset_to_98.c: function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98
1-swap.c: function that swaps the values of two integers
2-strlen.c: function that returns the length of a string
3-puts.c: function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout
4-print_rev.c: function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line, to stdout
5-rev_string.c: function that reverses a string
6-puts2.c: function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line, to stdout
7-puts_half.c: function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line, to stdout
8-print_array.c: function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line, to stdout
9-strcpy.c: function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest
